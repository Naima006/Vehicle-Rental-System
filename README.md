This Java project implements a vehicle rental system allowing users to rent vehicles. It
comprises classes for vehicles (with details like ID, type, status, and cost), customers
(with personal info and blood group), and rentals (linking vehicles and customers with
rental dates). The system includes a GUI for browsing available vehicles, renting them
by providing customer details, and updates the rental status accordingly. Serialization is
used to store and retrieve vehicle data, ensuring persistence between sessions
